## Overview

As specified in the technical task document, I primarily focused on the backend API project, which I developed using the .NET 8 framework. To ensure a well-structured application, I implemented clean architecture. For the database, I have set up an Azure SQL Server, and you can find the credential details included in the backend README file for your reference. I also added unit tests using the xUnit framework and hosted the application on Azure for easy access. Below is the Swagger URL for the API.

For the frontend, I used the ASP.NET Core Web App and have hosted it on Azure as well. It features a basic UI with CRUD operations. Below is the URL for the frontend.

Furthermore, I have included README files in both repositories to offer more detailed descriptions and make the projects easier to understand.
